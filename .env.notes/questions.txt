Why doesn't Git work?
-Open Gitbash in top-level of MDP
-run "git add -A"
-run "git commit -m 'Add new feature'"
---> Takes a long time to show up in BitBucket...

Why do I get this import error / how to resolve?
This file is being treated as an ES module because it has a '.js' file extension and 'D:\dev\projects\mdp\getter\package.json' contains "type": "module". To treat it as a CommonJS script, rename it to use the '.cjs' file extension.


Why wasn't path for web-driver working?  Had to move it into the working directory in order for it to be found.  Tried adding to path but did not work.
