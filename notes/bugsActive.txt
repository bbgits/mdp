BUG: webpack ... "webpack <5 used to include polyfills for node.js core modules by default. This is no longer the case.  Verify if you need this module and configure a polyfill for it."
DETAILS:
    - this has popped up a couple of times
    - after making some changes to .env, some things broke
    - problem re-emerged after editing client/src/config.js
    - using previous code in config.js avoids error, but does not hit the right .env folder, and data does not get saved to db from frontend
PARTIAL FIX:
    -  npm installing the package in the file location fixed some errors
    - add code to offending packages package.json: 
            "browser": {
            "fs": false,
            "path": false,
            "os": false
        },

FIX:
    - Sartaj helped me fix this initially...
    - 2nd time I fixed by editing server/index.js env variables
    - using previous code avoids error, but does not hit the right .env folder
